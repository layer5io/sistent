However, when choosing a size from the scale, ensure to identify possible use cases in proposed designs to ensure efficiency and reduce any chances of having redundant text styles. Remember that less is more and a particular font size can function in multiple capacities. After making a selection of sizes, if there is subsequent need for an additional size because of a recurring use case, then a suitable corresponding size can be chosen from the scale. This is a better practice."

This is because our base spacing value is 8px and as such, all the text sizes have been rounded off to a multiple of eight. This same principle is applied to the accompanying line heights of these text sizes as well.'

To this end, it is also imperative that the text styles selected account for these different layout sizes as well. As stated earlier, text styles can be used for multiple needs across a given design. The important thing is that necessary information is accurately conveyed and hierarchy and prominence is duly established.'

In such a case, an applicable principle is that one of the typefaces is used mostly for headings and subheadings, while the other is used for most paragraph and body text needs across the same design. Detailed research on typefaces and their compatibility will help to make informed decisions when it comes to choices of a typeface for font pairing."
