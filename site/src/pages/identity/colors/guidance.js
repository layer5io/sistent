Suffice to say that without proper structure, a good tonal palette can still be unproductive if the target audience have no clue what to do with it. We have organized color into a consumable form to ensure efficient and accurate application in order to achieve desired results."

It therefore becomes necessary to employ the use of tonal pallets. Tonal palettes are variations of a given hue comprising of the hue’s tints and shades. Armed with this array of harmonious colors, it becomes easier to combine them to actualize different UI elements or states, website pages and various products across any desired number of themes."

This structure will enable cohesive combinations across all implemented designs. With a base hue of ‘code-40’, tints and shades  are derived to complete the spectrum range.. These color selections are further supported by alert colors that complement the base Keppel Green. Blue, Green, Yellow, and Red hues were chosen for this."
