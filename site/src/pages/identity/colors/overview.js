Instead, tokens should be used to curate and implement the reusable values. More on tokens next.'

        In the dark theme, as layers are stacked towards the topmost surface, they become progressively lighter.

So as interactions progress from default to hover to pressed, this same principle may apply. However, when trying to establish prominence for other user interface needs, an inverse relationship may be more suitable. Hence, for these brilliant colors:  
        In the light theme, as prominence reduces, layers become progressively lighter.
        In the dark theme, as prominence reduces, layers become progressively darker."
